The FPI has been set up in response to the establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS) and operates under the responsibility of Baroness Ashton in her role as Vice President to the EC. The service is responsible for implementing EU external cooperation in relation to Common Foreign and Security Policy issues such as jointly managing the Instrument for Stability (which includes global security and development spending).

The FPI ranked last amongst the European Commission institutions and 47th overall.

The 2012 Index also assesses the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), in recognition of its important role in Japan’s development assistance. Profiles for each organisation are provided on the next page.
Japan has not signed IATI but has attended IATI Steering Committee meetings as an observer. It has committed to implement the Busan common standard, which includes all IATI information fields and the XML format. As part of the common standard agreement in June 2012, Japan has committed to producing an implementation schedule by December 2012.
Japan has not joined OGP.
In July 2012 the Prime Minister launched an ‘open data strategy for electronic administration’ to improve the transparency and credibility of administration and ‘to promote the utilisation of such data in future’. Implementation is being overseen by the Cabinet Secretariat with details being currently being worked out with input from ministers and experts.
Japan should produce an implementation schedule for the Busan common standard by December 2012, including ambitious commitments to publish the IATI elements of the standard and in the IATI XML format.
Japan should also consider signing IATI to demonstrate a commitment to transparency. Closer engagement with IATI will ensure that the Japanese aid system is best reflected in the IATI standard as it continues to develop.
Joining OGP would be an opportunity to share best practice in open data and open government approaches with other bilateral donors and with partners who receive Japanese aid.","MOFA has an online ODA project database. It includes information on the region, country, type of ODA, year and title of project. It also sometimes includes links to project summaries, procurement and evaluations. The new ODA mieruka website will also contain MOFA aid information.
MOFA ranked 23rd, scoring consistently across all indicators. Most project level information is dispersed across several websites, including a JICA project database, the MOFA website and the ODA project database, making it difficult to get a clear view of the totality of MOFA’s activities. The ODA project database only provides very basic project level information. This project information could be converted to the IATI format.

Every two years, all agencies are instructed by the Open Government Directive to publish Open Government Plans, detailing specific actions and a timetable for improving their transparency. Emphasis is placed on the timely publication of open and granular data.
In May 2012, the Administration released a Digital Government Strategy &mdash; Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People &mdash; that specified the use of “industry-standard markup language (e.g. XBRL, XML)... to the extent practicable”, in order to make open data efficient, effective and accessible.
The U.S. is a founding member of OGP and served as a co-chair until April 2012. It produced its OGP National Action Plan in September 2011, which included aid transparency commitments; specifically the implementation of the Dashboard, and quarterly publication of aid information in an internationally comparable format.
The U.S. agencies and programme assessed in the 2012 Index all showed progress since last year. Controlling for methodological changes to the 2012 Index, five out of six increased their scores from 2011, while State scored consistently with their 2011 score. Based on this measure, Treasury, PEPFAR and USAID posted the 5th, 6th and 9th largest percentage point increases from 2011 out of all donors, while DOD posted 12th and MCC posted 15th. Overall, the average score for all U.S. institutions increased from 28.1% in 2011 to 39.1% in 2012, again controlling for changes in the 2012 methodology, suggesting a trend towards greater aid transparency across the U.S. government.
To fulfil its commitment to IATI, the U.S. should produce an implementation schedule by December 2012 that sets out an ambitious timetable for initial publication by leading aid agencies in 2013, with a view to full implementation by 2015.
U.S. agencies administering foreign assistance should be instructed by OMB to publish timely, comprehensive and comparable information directly to the IATI Registry via a live XML feed, which can simultaneously supply the Dashboard with more comprehensive and more timely information as well as greatly reducing the burdens of USG reporting requirements. The information published to the Dashboard should be updated quarterly.
The U.S. government should revise its OGP National Action Plan to reflect commitments made in its forthcoming IATI implementation schedule and to institutionalise IATI implementation.","The Department’s F Bureau leads the design and implementation of the Foreign Assistance Dashboard, an important part of the Aid Transparency Agenda for Action. The only information provided so far by the Department of State to the Dashboard is “planning data”, provided back in December 2010. The Department of State’s 2012 Open Government Plan states that it is committed by December 2012 to add information from DOD, Treasury, Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to the Dashboard.
The Department of State ranked 46th overall, fifth amongst U.S. institutions assessed. The agency performed relatively poorly on the country and activity levels; the activity level score was significantly lower than average of all donors in the poor category, at just 12.0%. The Department’s overall score improved slightly from 2011, though this is due entirely to methodological changes in the 2012 Index. When these changes are controlled for, it scores consistently with its 2011 performance.
Department of State should release its obligation, spent, project and performance data to the Dashboard and publish all its information to the IATI Registry. It should build IATI into its internal systems as part of the next scheduled IT update. This will ensure that F Bureau and the Dashboard team fully embrace the Aid Transparency Agenda for Action. State should also fulfil Secretary Clinton’s Busan commitments by aiming for full implementation of the standard by 2015.",,yes,OpenTheGovernment.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,46,46,0.311164,0.527778,0.285714,0.12,poor,4,,Bilateral

USAID ranked 27th overall, second amongst the U.S. institutions assessed. It scored slightly above average among all donors on the organisation and country levels. It scored poorly at the activity level; among others, results and impact appraisals were not systematically available. The USAID map is currently not comprehensive for all recipient countries, though it is planned to expand its coverage to full comprehensiveness. USAID declined to provide specific feedback on the survey.
USAID should improve its programmatic data collection process by 2014 by making its IT system IATI compatible in its scheduled IT upgrade.

It is currently refreshing its publication twice-yearly, with quarterly publication expected after automation. Financial transactions are aggregated for each quarter, and none of the project documents or geo-coding from other internal World Bank transparency initiatives are currently included in the IATI data feed. It has a series of internal transparency initiatives, including Mapping for Results, World Bank Finances and the overarching Open Data Initiative. It also supports the Open Aid Partnership.
The World Bank performed very well, coming 2nd in the overall ranking and scoring 87.9%, moving it from the fair to good category. When controlling for changes to the 2012 methodology, IDA/IBRD had a modest increase on their 2011 score, which ranked first in the 2011 Index. IDA/IBRD was surpassed by DFID because of DFID’s significant improvement from the 2011 Index, though it is notable that IDA/IBRD and DFID tied 1st amongst all donors at the country level. IDA/IBRD also posted the highest score of all donors at the activity level. Most project information is available on their IATI dataset and their comprehensive, geo-coded project database.
The World Bank should continue to champion aid transparency both globally and internally. It should work towards automated publication to allow it to publish at least quarterly but preferably every month.
