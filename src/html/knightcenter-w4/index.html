<h1>US jobless rate mapped</h1>

<h2>About the Graph:</h2>
I am currently taking a <a href="http://open.journalismcourses.org/">MOOC</a> on infographic and data visualization with the Knight Center. This week’s challenge is to redesign The Guardian’s DataBlog post about <a target="_blank" href ="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2011/sep/08/us-unemployment-obama-jobs-speech-state-map">US state unemployment</a>. <br/>
Here is my submission.<br/>
The graph was made with the excellent <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> javascript framework, for me it was the first time I used it.<br/>
<i>Note: I spent some time on the D3 framework to the detriment of the content, as I stated in the section "Remains to be done".</i>

<h2>How to use the graph:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Click the left bar graph to choose month/year.</li>
	<li>Mouseover on a state to see its unemployment history graph (since 2009) and compare with the U.S. national rate.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Remains to be done:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>top/worst 10 states, </li>
	<li>merge the left graph with the graph above the map,</li>
	<li>other informations: GDPs, density, ...</li>
	<li>add graph showing unemployment history of all states (multiline chart, parallel coordinates, ...?)</li> 
</ul>
